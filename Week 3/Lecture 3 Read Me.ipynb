    "# Python for Data Science - Session 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, with a particular focus on creating classes, handling inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism. The main hands-on tasks guide users through building a course registration system with methods for managing student enrollments, course assignments, and grade calculations. Below is an overview of each section and key elements of the hands-on tasks.\n",

    "### Usage\n",
    "- Overview of Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "- The OOP paradigm enables modular, reusable, and maintainable code by using objects that represent real-world entities. This session covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classes and Objects: A class serves as a blueprint, while an object is an instance of the class.\n",
    "- Attributes and Methods: Attributes are properties of a class, and methods are functions that define behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key OOP Concepts:\n",
    "- Inheritance: Allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Hides the internal state of objects, ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "- Polymorphism: Enables the same operation to behave differently on different classes.\n",
    "- Abstraction: Simplifies complex realities by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Structure and Key Concepts\n",
    "- Class Creation: The Pet class serves as a basic template, with attributes and methods defining an object's characteristics and behavior.\n",
    "- Inheritance: Extends classes such as Dog and Cat from Pet to inherit properties, with specific customizations for each subclass.\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Uses private attributes and methods to control access within classes, demonstrated in the Student class example.\n",
    "- Polymorphism: Shows how the same method can work differently for various objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hands-On Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Registration System\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Implement a Course class to manage course information and student enrollments.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Methods:\n",
    "- add_student(student): Adds a student to the course.\n",
    "- remove_student(student): Removes a student from the course.\n",
    "- show_students(): Displays all enrolled students.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Student Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Develop a Learner class representing a student with methods to enroll in and drop courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Attributes:\n",
    "- name, ID, address, enrolled_courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Methods:\n",
    "- register(course): Enrolls the student in a specified course.\n",
    "- withdraw(course): Withdraws the student from a course.\n",
    "- display_courses(): Displays the student's registered courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Central Registration System\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Implement a Registration class to manage multiple students and courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- add_student(learner): Adds a new learner.\n",
    "- add_course(course): Adds a new course.\n",
    "- enroll_in_course(learner, course): Enrolls a learner in a specified course.\n",
    "- drop_course(learner, course): Drops a course for a learner.\n",
    "- show_all_courses(): Lists all available courses.\n",
    "- show_all_students(): Lists all enrolled students.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Homework - GPA Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Extend the Learner class to manage grades and calculate GPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- assign_grade(course, grade): Assigns a grade for a course.\n",
    "- calculate_gpa(): Calculates and returns the student's GPA based on assigned grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Additional Features in Registration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate GPA by student name or ID using calculate_gpa_by_name and calculate_gpa_by_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "This README provides a structured outline to understand and navigate the core functionalities, with emphasis on practical hands-on tasks as specified in the class exercises."
