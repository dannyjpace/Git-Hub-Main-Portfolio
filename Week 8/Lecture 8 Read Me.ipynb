    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes the following attributes:\n",
    "- **Student Name**: Identifies individual students.\n",
    "- **Study Time**: Hours spent studying by each student.\n",
    "- **Grade**: Academic performance of students in percentage.\n",
    "- **Course**: The course each student is enrolled in.\n",
    "- **Gender**: Gender of the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 1: Line Plot for Study Time by Student**\n",
    "- **Objective**: Visualize how study time varies across students and identify the student with the highest study time.\n",
    "- **Methodology**:\n",
    "  - Use a line plot with markers for clarity.\n",
    "  - Highlight and annotate the student with the highest study time.\n",
    "- **Key Insight**:\n",
    "  - The line plot provides a clear comparison of study time across students, emphasizing the highest achiever.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 2: Histogram for Grade Distribution**\n",
    "- **Objective**: Understand grade distribution and identify the range with the highest frequency.\n",
    "- **Methodology**:\n",
    "  - Use a histogram with KDE for a smooth distribution curve.\n",
    "  - Annotate the grade range with the highest frequency.\n",
    "- **Key Insight**:\n",
    "  - The grade range with the highest frequency provides insights into overall academic performance trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 3: ECDF Plot for Grades**\n",
    "- **Objective**: Analyze the cumulative distribution of grades and highlight the percentage of students scoring below 85.\n",
    "- **Methodology**:\n",
    "  - Create an ECDF plot with gridlines and annotations for key thresholds.\n",
    "  - Highlight the cumulative percentage for scores below 85.\n",
    "- **Key Insight**:\n",
    "  - The ECDF plot effectively illustrates grade distributions and highlights critical benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 4: Strip Plot for Grade Distribution by Course**\n",
    "- **Objective**: Compare grade distributions across courses and identify the course with the most variability in grades.\n",
    "- **Methodology**:\n",
    "  - Use a jittered strip plot for better visibility of overlapping data points.\n",
    "  - Calculate and annotate the course with the highest grade variability.\n",
    "- **Key Insight**:\n",
    "  - The strip plot emphasizes variations in performance within each course.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 5: Swarm Plot for Study Time by Gender**\n",
    "- **Objective**: Compare study times across genders and identify which gender has a higher average study time.\n",
    "- **Methodology**:\n",
    "  - Combine swarm and strip plots for detailed visualization.\n",
    "  - Plot horizontal lines to indicate average study times for each gender.\n",
    "- **Key Insight**:\n",
    "  - The visualization highlights gender-based differences in study habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 6: Point Plot for Average Grade by Course**\n",
    "- **Objective**: Analyze average grades for each course and highlight the course with the highest average grade.\n",
    "- **Methodology**:\n",
    "  - Use a point plot with error bars for standard deviation.\n",
    "  - Annotate the course with the highest average grade for emphasis.\n",
    "- **Key Insight**:\n",
    "  - The point plot provides a concise summary of course performance while emphasizing top-performing courses.\n",
