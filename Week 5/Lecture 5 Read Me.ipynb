    "# README: Annotation File Processing and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project involves analyzing annotation files by organizing, counting, and filtering based on specified conditions. The exercises aim to explore the dataset comprehensively, focusing on annotation grouping by month, analyzing specific time periods, and identifying statistical insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks Overview\n",
    "The exercises are split into three distinct tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Count annotations per month and year** and identify the month with the highest number of annotations.\n",
    "2. **Create a dictionary grouping annotations by month** and save the results to JSON and Pickle formats.\n",
    "3. **Filter and display annotations from the second half of 2024**, sorted from oldest to newest.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Count Annotations Per Month and Year\n",
    "**Objective**: Analyze the number of annotations grouped by month and year, and identify the month with the most annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process**:\n",
    "1. **Import necessary libraries**: \n",
    "   - `os`, `glob`, `re`, and `datetime` for file operations and metadata extraction.\n",
    "2. **Extract Metadata**:\n",
    "   - Use regex to extract `year` and `month` from annotation filenames.\n",
    "3. **Group by Month**:\n",
    "   - Count annotations for each month using a nested dictionary.\n",
    "4. **Identify Peak Month**:\n",
    "   - Use `max()` to determine the month with the most annotations.\n",
    "5. **Display Results**:\n",
    "   - Print a structured report, including total files, monthly annotation counts, and the peak month.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outcome**:\n",
    "- A detailed report of annotation counts per month and the month with the highest annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Output**:\n",
    "\n",
    "====================================================================== Annotation Analysis Report\n",
    "Total files in folder: 206 Total annotation files processed: 206 Annotations per year and month: Year: 2024, Month: 01, Annotations: 27 Year: 2024, Month: 06, Annotations: 52\n",

    "### Task 2: Group Annotations by Month and Save to JSON/Pickle\n",
    "**Objective**: Create a dictionary where each key is a month, and the value is a list of annotation filenames corresponding to that month. Save the results to JSON and Pickle formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process**:\n",
    "1. **Extract Metadata**:\n",
    "   - Use regex to parse `date` and `time` from annotation filenames.\n",
    "   - Convert these to `datetime` objects.\n",
    "2. **Group by Month**:\n",
    "   - Organize filenames into a dictionary, keyed by the month of their creation.\n",
    "3. **Save Data**:\n",
    "   - Save the grouped dictionary to a JSON file with `json.dump()`.\n",
    "   - Save the same dictionary to a Pickle file with `pickle.dump()`.\n",
    "4. **Load and Verify JSON**:\n",
    "   - Read the JSON file back and print its contents to confirm correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outcome**:\n",
    "- A JSON file (`annotations_by_month.json`) and a Pickle file (`annotations_by_month.pkl`) containing the grouped annotations.\n",

    "**Objective**: Identify annotation files from the second half of 2024 (July–December) and display them in chronological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process**:\n",
    "1. **Extract Metadata**:\n",
    "   - Use regex to parse `date` and `time` from filenames and convert to `datetime` objects.\n",
    "2. **Filter by Date**:\n",
    "   - Filter annotations with dates between July and December 2024.\n",
