    "## Python Task Series - Lecture 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- This repository contains the Python coding exercises from Lecture 2\n",
    "which cover fundamental programming concepts such as control flow, \n",
    "data filtering, list management, and unit conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.x installed on your system.\n",
    "- A code editor or IDE (such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook) for running the scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Clone the Repository\n",
    "1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/dannyjpace/Git-Hub-Main-Portfolio/Week2/Read_Me.git\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1 - FizzBuzz\n",
    "- Task Overview\n",
    "The FizzBuzz problem is a common programming challenge that requires printing numbers from 1 to n, while following these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a number is divisible by 3, print \"Fizz\".\n",
    "If a number is divisible by 5, print \"Buzz\".\n",
    "If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print \"FizzBuzz\".\n",
    "For all other numbers, print the number itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code Walkthrough\n",
    "1. The function fizzbuzz(n) iterates through all numbers from 1 to n.\n",
    "2. It checks if a number is divisible by 3 and 5 using the modulus operator %.\n",
    "3. Based on the conditions, it prints \"Fizz\", \"Buzz\", or \"FizzBuzz\", or the number itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 2 - Basic Data Filtering\n",
    "- Task Overview\n",
    "This task demonstrates how to filter data based on type. The script processes a mixed list containing various data types and outputs only the integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code Walkthrough\n",
    "1. The mixed_data list contains values of different types (integers, strings, floats).\n",
    "2. The filtering is done using a list comprehension, where the isinstance() function checks if each element is an integer.\n",
    "3. The filtered integers are then printed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 3 - Simple To-Do List\n",
    "- Task Overview\n",
    "In this task, you build a simple command-line to-do list application, where users can:\n",
    "\n",
    "Add tasks.\n",
    "Display the tasks in a formatted manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code Walkthrough\n",
    "1. The list todo_list stores all tasks.\n",
    "2. The function add_task() adds a task to the list.\n",
    "3. The function show_tasks() displays the current to-do list, formatting it with an index for each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 - Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion\n",
    "- Task Overview\n",
    "This task involves writing a Python function to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula:\n",
    "°F = (°C * 9/5) + 32\n",
    "The task helps practice writing functions and using loops for list iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code Walkthrough\n",
    "1. The function celsius_to_fahrenheit() takes a temperature in Celsius and returns the equivalent Fahrenheit temperature.\n",
    "2. The for loop iterates over a list of temperatures in Celsius, converts each to Fahrenheit, and prints the result."
